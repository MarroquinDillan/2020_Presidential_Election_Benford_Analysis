# Benford-Analysis-of-the-2020-Presidential-Race
This is a deep statistical data analysis of the 2020 Presidential Race with the aim of detecting for ballot fraud or manipulation. Analysis was conducted at the state and county level with Washoe County of Nevada as the point of reference. Benford's Law analysis using R and SQL was conducted at each level to detect for ballot fraud and manipulation.

In this respository you will find the research paper I have submitted detailing my analysis, method of analysis, charts, conclusions, and papers referenced. The R Code is also pasted at the bottom of the research paper. Please feel free to message me if you are curious about the results or would like to do follow up research.

Lastly, this analysis was done while I was just beginning to learn the R programming language, so apologies if the code is hard to read. I have become a much better coder since then :)
